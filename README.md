## About the Project

the project is a simple classic Ping-Pong game. <br>
intended for two players but can be played with one player, but you have to play against yourself. <br>
the game is very similar for online bong game. <br>
you control a small Bat Up and down to try to push the ball away. <br>
because the game is very classic, there is no score or anything like that, once the ball is missed you lose and the game ends <br>
